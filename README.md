# Evolution-Tree-Calibration
Simulation of calibration fo evolution trees

In a very simplistic format, we can simulate the situation on an arbitrary small phylogenetic tree, when the tree stays uncalibrated and when it gets calibrated by introducing reference calibration points. Each branch, lineage of species, is assigned a different evolution rate. My two simulations help illustrate the implications. On one side simulation, we do not imply calibration points as reference, and rates stay uncalibrated. Because there are no calibration points, the timeline for node ages stays ambiguous and variable forever. On the other side simulation, in contrast, we impose few calibration points to relate certain nodes to known times-in this specific simulation we suppose the root is at 10 (arbitrary unit of time) and another internal node is anchored at 4 (arbitrary unit of time)-The calibration points force the remaining node times to become anchored after about 11 seconds simulation time accordingly.
